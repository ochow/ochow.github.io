## I'm Oi Kam Chow.

Welcome to my site! I am excited to meet you as I journey through computer science.

### About Me

I am studying Computer Science in Purdue University and planning to graduate in 2019. "Coding is fun" is the first comment I have after started learning programming. More than simply fun, I also admire the computing power and its influence to the world. I wish to be part of the field to create a better world.
